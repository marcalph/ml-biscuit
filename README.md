# ML biscuit

A standardized (python only) ML project template with boilerplate code compliant with my OCDs - currently WIP, should be moved to a templating tool (e.g. cookiecutter) instead of the current copy/paste logic.

### required tooling

My opinionated hot take on what a python project should leverage as tooling encompasses:
- a packaging tool, here `poetry` 
- a minimal local ci-suite, here inmplemented using `pre-commit`

### todos

- [ ] better docker
- [ ] more plotting
- [ ] more eda
- [ ] more eval
- [ ] add cli support
